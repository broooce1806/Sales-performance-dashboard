Overview
This project presents an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard allows users to analyze actual vs. target sales performance across teams and individual salespeople over a 14-month period. The goal is to provide actionable insights and clear visualizations for business decision-making.

Features
KPI Summary Cards: Quick view of total actual sales, target sales, variance (value and percentage), and months with targets achieved.

Monthly Trend Visualization: Compare actual and target sales over time, with annotations for periods when sales targets were met.
